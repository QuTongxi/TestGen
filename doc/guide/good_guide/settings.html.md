Configuring test settings
=========================

This page discusses how to configure the behavior of a single Hypothesis test, or of an entire test suite.

Configuring a single test
-------------------------

Hypothesis lets you configure the default behavior of a test using the `@settings` decorator. You can use settings to configure how many examples Hypothesis generates, how Hypothesis replays failing examples, and the verbosity level of the test, among others.

Using `@settings` on a single test looks like this:

```python
from hypothesis import given, settings, strategies as st

@given(st.integers())
@settings(max_examples=200)
def runs_200_times_instead_of_100(n):
    pass
```

You can put `@settings` either before or after `@given`. Both are equivalent.

Changing the number of examples
-------------------------------

If you have a test which is very expensive or very cheap to run, you can change the number of examples (inputs) Hypothesis generates with the `max_examples` setting:

The default is 100 examples.

Other settings options
----------------------

Here are a few of the more commonly used setting values:

- `settings.phases` controls which phases of Hypothesis run, like replaying from the database or generating new inputs.
- `settings.database` controls how and if Hypothesis replays failing examples.
- `settings.verbosity` can print debug information.
- `settings.derandomize` makes Hypothesis deterministic. (*Two kinds of testing* discusses when and why you might want that).

Changing settings across your test suite
----------------------------------------

In addition to configuring individual test functions with `@settings`, you can configure test behavior across your test suite using a settings profile. This might be useful for creating a development settings profile which runs fewer examples, or a settings profile in CI which connects to a separate database.

To create a settings profile, use `register_profile()`:

```python
from hypothesis import HealthCheck, settings

settings.register_profile("fast", max_examples=10)
```

You can place this code in any file which gets loaded before your tests get run. This includes an `__init__.py` file in the test directory or any of the test files themselves. If using pytest, the standard location to place this code is in a `conftest.py` file (though an `__init__.py` or test file will also work).

Note that registering a new profile will not affect tests until it is loaded with `load_profile()`:

```python
from hypothesis import HealthCheck, settings

settings.register_profile("fast", max_examples=10)
# any tests executed before loading this profile will still use the
# default active profile of 100 examples.
settings.load_profile("fast")
# any tests executed after this point will use the active fast
# profile of 10 examples.
```

There is no limit to the number of settings profiles you can create. Hypothesis creates a profile called `"default"`, which is active by default. You can also explicitly make it active at any time using `settings.load_profile("default")`, if for instance you wanted to revert a custom profile you had previously loaded.

Loading profiles from environment variables
-------------------------------------------

Using an environment variable to load a settings profile is a useful trick for choosing a settings profile depending on the environment:

```python
>>> import os
>>> from hypothesis import settings, Verbosity
>>> settings.register_profile("long", max_examples=1000)
>>> settings.register_profile("fast", max_examples=10)
>>> settings.register_profile("debug", max_examples=10, verbosity=Verbosity.verbose)
>>> settings.load_profile(os.getenv("HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE", "default"))
```

If using pytest, you can also easily select the active profile with `--hypothesis-profile`:

```bash
$ pytest --hypothesis-profile fast
```
