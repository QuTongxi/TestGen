# Detect Hypothesis tests

How to dynamically determine whether a test function has been defined with Hypothesis.

## Via `is_hypothesis_test`

The most straightforward way is to use `is_hypothesis_test()`:

```python
from hypothesis import is_hypothesis_test

@given(st.integers())
def f(n): ...

assert is_hypothesis_test(f)
```

This works for stateful tests as well:

```python
from hypothesis import is_hypothesis_test
from hypothesis.stateful import RuleBasedStateMachine

class MyStateMachine(RuleBasedStateMachine): ...

assert is_hypothesis_test(MyStateMachine.TestCase().runTest)
```

## Via pytest

If you’re working with pytest, the Hypothesis pytest plugin automatically adds the `@pytest.mark.hypothesis` mark to all Hypothesis tests. You can use `node.get_closest_marker("hypothesis")` or similar methods to detect the existence of this mark.
